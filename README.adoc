_Chewin' The Fat Bot_ is a {slack}[Slack] application targeting {apigw}[Amazon
API Gateway] and {lambda}[AWS Lambda] as runtime environment.

NOTE: The intended deployment of this software is as an {intint}[internal
integration], and the implementation will reflect this assumption.

== Development

{pipenv}[Pipenv] makes Python dependency management sane, so your development
environment will need it installed. You also need {py36dl}[Python 3.6]
installed, although Pipenv may help you with this if {pyenv}[pyenv] is
installed.
